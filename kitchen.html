                    <p class="section__para">When you have a favorite color—even if that favorite color is black or white—why decorate with anything else? 
                        Besides, a room dipped in a single color is visually transfixing and very, very cool. Sure, variation is important, 
                        but you can inject personality and intrigue with textural contrast and tonal nuances. And aside from looking stylish, 
                        going monochrome makes it infinitely easier to come up with a color scheme, thus making the entire design process much less stressful. 
                        To give you a taste of the trend's beguiling effect, we rounded up nineteen monochromatic rooms, from neutral to vibrant, minimalist to maximalist,
                        and everything in between. So keep reading for designer spaces that'll inspire you to commit to a monochromatic color scheme and never look back.
                        Those things that you mentioned–curtains and throw pillows–are definitely good ways to add color to an otherwise neutral, 
                        monochromatic room. You could also add artwork, accessories like vases and picture frames, 
                        fabric (or wallpaper, or paint) to the back of built-in bookcases, chandeliers and lamps, etc.

                         in a bedroom because the bed is a natural focal point. Pillows can update a room instantly by adding volume, pattern, texture, color,
                          and personality. Here, a subtle cream backdrop is brought into focus with a collection of lively pillows.

                        a super luxe luxe bedroom is not in the cards for me right now. But luckily, 
                        it’s easier and cheaper than you think to “fake it ‘til you make it” when decorating a bedroom.

                          Below you’ll find a handful of tips to take your sleep space to the next level with as a little effort—and cash investment—as possible.

                    While a lot of people consider every space in their home multipurpose, 
                    many experts believe the bedroom should be for sleeping and relaxing only.

                <p class="second__section-p">There is nothing more inviting than walking into a home that reflects the home owners’
                   sense of style and personality. And, it is important to remember that decorating a 
                   home well does not always entail spending a large sum of money. 
                   Great décor ideas can be implemented on a budget too. 
                   “Styling a space with simplistic ideas can add strong design accents and personalise the space.
                    Principally keeping the design minimal will make the space look trendy and stylish while remaining low in cost.<br> Keep the space as uncluttered as possible,” .
                    Upcycling, recycling and DIY are effective ideas to do up your home using limited resources. 
                    Since the bedroom is a personal space where one spends a great amount of time, 
                    it can be the perfect canvas to execute your ideas. So, whether you are a student, 
                    newly employed professional or anyone who is living on a budget, here are some DIY bedroom décor ideas that do not necessarily create a dent on your savings<br>
                    Mirrors, floor lamps and even pendant lights can transform the look of the bedroom without burning a hole in your pocket. 
                     “Add a wall light with wires above the side tables. This does not require any electrical chasing and looks very cool,” says Designer.
                      Plants are always a game changer and can enliven the look and feel of a space.  
                      Low maintenance plants like pothos, spider plants and even snake plants not only enhance aesthetics but also purify air.
                        Paint your planters in bright colours to lend your plants a unique look. Air plants and terrariums are good ideas too.
